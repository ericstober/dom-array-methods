# DOM Array Methods

A JavaScript project that demonstrates various array manipulation methods by interacting with DOM elements. This project provides an interactive way to learn and explore how common JavaScript array method work in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- Fetch random user data and display it in the DOM.
- Perform array operations such as:
  - Doubling the wealth of all users.
  - Sorting users by their wealth.
  - Filtering only millionaires.
  - Calculating the total wealth of all users.
- Dynamically updare the DOM based on these operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericstober/dom-array-methods.git
cd dom-array-methods
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or local server to run the project.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Use the buttons provided to fetch users and apply different array methods.
3. Observe how the DOM updates dynamically based on the operations.

## Array Methods Used

The following JavaScript array method are showcased:

- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `sort()`
- `reduce()`
- `forEach()`
- `push()`
